## Introduction

We aimed to create a state of the art online mutliplayer chess game where users can easily create
and join games with different rules. Besides there is a extensive user statistics page and a chat 
functionality. The main focus was implementing our own chess engine where all possible moves can 
be fetched from the backend and displayed to the user. This enables users with less knowledge about
the game to perform better.
